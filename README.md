# About testing-prose

I'm using this github repository/project to test prose (and document editing on github in general).

I'm also practising [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

## What I've done so far

1. Set up repository on github
2. Installed windows client
3. Started editing this default readme in [prose.io](http://prose.io)
4. Installed mac client

## Editing from outside prose

Because it's just a markdown file, and we're pushing stuff through github, then presumably I can edit from anywhere. This section was added using Sublime, which I've also just registered (it's much nicer on OS X than it is on Windows).
